# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer
<!-- I think a better way to word this is by saying:
Problems where that require searching or problems that can be broken down even more until a base case is reached.

Giving some examples of problems that fit this description would make this response better. Such as the problems you were asked to solve in this assignment.

 -->
Searching for something and whatever it is looking for it will break that down even more until the base case is reached
