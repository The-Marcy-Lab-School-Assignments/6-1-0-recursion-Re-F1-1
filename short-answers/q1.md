# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer
 - A recursive function is where the function calls itself until a base case is reached
 - Invoking a function within a function - a recursive function inception
 - A case is what stops the function from running if the condition is met, since a recursive function is a essentially an infinite loop
